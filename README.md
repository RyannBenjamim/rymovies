This is a movie website project built with ReactJS and CSS Modules, leveraging the TMDb (The Movie Database) API. The goal of this project is to allow users to search for movies and retrieve detailed information about each movie, such as title, release date, genre, runtime, critic rating, and also watch related videos.

## Key Features

- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies using keywords.
- **Detailed Information:** Search results display important information about each movie, including title, release date, genre, runtime, and critic rating.
- **Video Playback:** Users have access to videos related to the selected movie, allowing them to watch trailers and other multimedia content.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: We used ReactJS as the main framework to build the dynamic and responsive user interface.
- CSS Modules: CSS Modules were used to style React components in a modular way, avoiding style conflicts.
- TMDb API: We integrated the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch up-to-date movie information, including details and videos.
